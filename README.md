# Mnist-GAN

Implementation of GAN using PyTorch and tested on MNIST Dataset.

No saving checkpoints saving/loading implemented. Please adjust to your needs accordingly.

The current runnable code is in `trainGAN.py`, and the models are stored in `model.py`. The `graviti_API.py` is the ongoing SDK for Graviti. The SDK for faster retrieval of datasets from their platform is currently being implemented. You may update the dataloaders accordingly once the SDK implementation is refined for use of any other datasets.
